Lists on the other hand are still iterable but they are able to change and they can hold multiple types of data types including ints, floats, and strings. Dicts are similar to lists meaning they are mutable but they are stored in a value pair which essentially means that you can only access a item from the dict by calling on the value pair."

You would use this before using a list or dict for a few reasons including the fact that the numpy array would probably work quicker due to the minimal data load compared to lists. You are also able to do some semi-complex math in just a few line of code instead of having to write a ton of code."
